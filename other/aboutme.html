<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Muhammad Abdulba, and I am currently seeking a job in the field of data or front-end development. I recently graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. Throughout my academic journey, I have taken a variety of courses such as ASIC Design, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity Engineering, and Data Structures, which have provided me with a strong foundation in both hardware and software aspects of computing.</p>

<p>I possess skills in several programming languages including Assembly, C++, and C, with a particular focus on Python for large language models and machine learning. My professional goal is to start my career in front-end development, where I can leverage my coding skills and creative problem-solving abilities. As I gain more experience, I aim to transition into back-end development and further delve into data and machine learning to become a versatile and well-rounded engineer.</p>

<p>In addition to my technical skills, I am passionate about various sports, especially football and MMA. I also enjoy reading literature, with a particular interest in manga. These hobbies not only provide me with relaxation and inspiration but also help me stay motivated and balanced in my professional and personal life.</p>
